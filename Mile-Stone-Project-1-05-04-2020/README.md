OVERVIEW:

HI reader,

Welcome to my milestone-one project for code Institutes 1 of 4 projects for my journey to become a full stack developer.

In my current project I picked to do it on, is about a gym because in 2020 alot of pwople have become close/ connected to fitness, by using it to get in better shape, a hobby, a way to meet up with friends, to improve how they look and for improving mental health etc. and it shows the gyms home page designed into sections where at the top of the page where the gyms logo is and also the nav bar feature, where the gallery has images of the gym and its members working out (taken from free open source images)(https://www.pexels.com/collections/crossfit-gym-exercise-workout-training-rhf4lf3/) head of my gym introduction page we have a jumbotron showing the company slogan, a highlighted element where if you purchase a membership you get in return a free extension onto your membership, then down below we have features about the gym for example different types or areas of exercise that one person can do at this facility, with a option to view the time tables or book in with a Personal Trainer, then below that we have a footer section, used footer layout from (https://mdbootstrap.com/products/jquery-ui-kit/) styled it with my own colors and fonts, but and added links to the titles. with a quote on the left about the company, in the center of the footer we have links to different areas of the site that would be available to an existing member or to a new upoming member, then to the right of the footer we have the contact deatils like address, email, contact information etc with a copyright logo at the bottom of the footer.

When the site is viewed on a mobile version I have made some of the content be hidden due to too much content being shown and it looks too squashed so I hid some less important parts, when viewed on a mobile the navbar condenses and becomes a burger feature/ drop down menu which has the sections still present, just not clustered all over the screen...


UX:
This site is aimed at all individuals, young or old, its a site advertising a gym and its features and offers a free extended period if you join, it has images of a pool, fitness classes and the gym, it has the option of taking Personal Trainer classes, swimming lessons, and also in the navbar has the option of booking a fitness class from the list given in the classes section. The extended period of time is added to entise people to buy the membership and the classes shown are to work together in groups having fun while getting fit, also if your new it has the option to book in with a personal trainers to show you and send you on the right path to get a fitter lifestyle.

Features:
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

In my nabar we have different sections a new customer or current can enter to view the gyms services and images.
In the jumbotron we have a slogan then a T&C for age and also a promotion standing out for viewers.
Then I added a modal sign up button for new customers to sign up and create a username etc.
I added a backround Image of a gym area and also made the opacity of my jumbotron 0.7 so the background could still be seen throught the jumbotron while scrolling.
then I added images to each info card showing features and explaining the features in the gym with buttons to enquire and timetables for the classes etc.
then in the footer we have accesible links to contact us, sign up to be a PT, contact us etc, with addreses and details etc.

Features Left to Implement:

I would add a video section of a tour of the gym, show casing all of the facilities better, showing the staff, and maybe some customer reviews on the classes and how they find the gym etc, also i would add a blog section for customers and new to join customers to pass information, ask questions, and see live updates of the gym regarding new equipment, facilities to come, temporary closing times and more.

13/04/2020: I added a sign in button to the nav using the btn btn-danger feature from bootstrap4 for members to sign in and when it minimises on mobile devices the sign in button disapears but on the footer members can access the account via the members account link so there is still access for mobile users.

Technologies Used:

I used HTML, CSS and Bootsrap 4 for my project.
I added in the Jquery and Javascript links at the base of my HTML document to make my drop down menu active when mobile version is iniatiated.

I used HTML for word typing and editting, adding features like rows, tables, images etc.
CSS for atyling the features in the html document and also styleing the entire document.
I used bootstrap4 for additional help and structured layouts for regions of my developing site and speed up the building proccess, better and well formulated structures, also I used bootstrap for making buttons and navbar features.

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Different Browsers and screen sizes:

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

Deployment:

Each time I reached a point during my website editing and ceation I pushed my project to github using the terminal commands and once I did that I rechecked the site github to verify that the update and projected was pushed succesfully with peace of mind.

for example which i thought was pretty cool and interesting(the jumbotron feature).

I also used slack groups for guidance and assitance from the well educated mentors assigned,
